The main concept behind the project was to provide a smooth flow for the ambulance to reach the hospitals in time and thereby minimizing the delay caused by traffic congestion.

The Microcontroller based RFID system was used to alter the traffic lights upon its arrival at traffic light junction which would save lives at critical time.

Ambulance sends emergency signal to traffic control to control the traffic pattern according to the traffic density and based on ambulance driver requirement.
